## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
I would assume that you would implement more full adders to increase the range.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?

The XOR gate is the truth table representation of one bit addition.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number a two bit adder could handle would be 6 since the maximum number 2-bits can give you is 3 so 3+3=6. Otherwise there would be overflow and your answer would be wrong.
